daap.js
=======

This is an implementation of the Digital Audio Access Protocol on top of node.js - you can use it to share music to Apple's iTunes app. You can find out more about DAAP at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Access_Protocol

Yes, this works with iTunes 10!

Prerequisites
-------------
daap.js was developeed against node.js v0.2.0 from Macports, on Mac OSX 10.6.4 - but there's nothing tricky going on here so it should work much more broadly.

If the node_mdns (http://github.com/agnat/node_mdns) modeule is found daap.js will advertise itself over Bonjour/ zerconf - this will make your server pop up as a 'shared library' in iTunes.

Getting Started
---------------
This is more of a sketch than a consumer app so you'll definitely need to do some tinkering to get up and running. This may include:
 - modifying the Makefile to point to your node.js executable and library locations
 - changing the listen port in eg/server.js
 - specifying the songs to share in eg/server.js (mp3s only)

The included Makefile has a 'run' target that will start the server.
a look at eg/server.js to configure listen port etc.
